BluesPhone by Brian Nitz

An Etherphone is also known as a Theremin. The musician plays music by
waving their hands in front of a pair of antenna. One antenna controls
the pitch and the other controls the loudness. Its spooky electronic sound
was commonly used in the sound tracks of science fiction movies. The
traditional etherphone doesn't play discrete notes and so the musician
would either slide from one note to the next or modulate the loudness and
carefully position their other hand to the position of the next note.

The optical etherphone uses light detectors instead of antenna to detect
the position of the musician's hand. In the BluesPhone variation, there 
is the option to move to the next note in discrete steps corresponding
to the Blues scale, pentatonic scale, arabic scale, equally-tempered octave
scale or the continuous non-quantized range of a traidtional theremin.

When started, this program expects that the musician will block the sensor
to calibrate the low range and then unblock the sensor to calibrate the high 
range. Block the sensor again to select the next scale.
